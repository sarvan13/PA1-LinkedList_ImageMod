# PA1-LinkedList_ImageMod
This is a project I did for my intorduction to Data Structures and Algorithms course. It focused on Linked Lists, Pointers, Vectors and Image Processing.

I wrote block.h, block.cpp, grid.h, grid.cpp and I have heavily modified main.cpp.

There are a few tests written in main.cpp, it takes PNGs from the pa1/images folder, and outputs modified images based on commmands specified in main.cpp. To change use custom images, simply place the PNG in the images directory, and modify main.cpp accordingly. 

## Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/sarvan13/PA1-LinkedList_ImageMod.git
```

## Running
```
cd pa1/
make
./pa1
```

Outputs are sent to pa1/images, or as written in main.
